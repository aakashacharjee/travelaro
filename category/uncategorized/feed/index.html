							<p>Siliguri, which has a population of 500,000, is one of the most significant cities in North Bengal.  Siliguri is both a commercial center and a stopover for travelers heading to various tourist spots in the northern part of the state. It is located along the river Teesta at the foothills of the Himalayas. Siliguri is the only city after Kolkata to have its airport, which makes it easier for the city to connect with the rest of the nation and to have excellent road connectivity with surrounding places. Here is a brief travel guide for visiting Siliguri and taking advantage of its tourism.</p><ol><li><u>Climate and the Ideal Time to Visit</u></li></ol><ul><li><u>From (April to June), the summer</u></li></ul><p>Siliguri has exceptionally hot summers because it is not at a higher altitude but rather at the foothills of the <strong>Himalayas</strong>. The rising temperature is accompanied by a steady increase in humidity and heat. The majority of visitors the city encounters at this time are individuals who are using Siliguri as a stopover on route to hilly areas to avoid the heat.</p><ul><li><u>(November to January) Winter:</u></li></ul><p>Winter is the ideal season to go if you want to stay in the city and explore it. The temperature continues to fluctuate between 8°C and 25°C despite a significant drop. There are several magnificent tourist attractions in Siliguri that may be explored before continuing to Darjeeling to see the stunning Kanchenjungha, go paragliding in Kalimpong, go hiking in Sandakphu, or see wild animals in the Dooars. From Siliguri to Darjeeling, taking the toy train is highly advised.</p><ol start="2"><li><u>Things to Do</u></li></ol><ul><li><u>Go on a Safari:</u></li></ul><p>Good news is available for wildlife enthusiasts. For the enjoyment of visitors, there is the <strong>Bengal Safari Park</strong>, where jeep and elephant safaris are planned. Elephants, tigers, leopards, and other wild animals are all housed in the park. As the jeeps transport the tourists very far into the forest, it is a thrill to see them lying around there. The atmosphere of calmness and serenity offers much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis.</p><ul><li><u>Traveling by <strong>Himalayan Train</strong>:</u></li></ul><p>One of the country&#8217;s last remaining <strong>mountain railways</strong> is the 200-year-old one in Darjeeling. It is appropriately recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It still runs often between Darjeeling and New Jalpaiguri and provides a stunning view of the surroundings, with mountains in the distance flowing through the vast tea estates. In the city, you absolutely must use the train.</p><ul><li><u>Visiting <strong>Dudhia</strong> for a Day:</u></li></ul><p>On the banks of the River Balaton, the hamlet of <strong>Dudhia</strong> is incredibly attractive. Only 25 kilometers from Siliguri, this breathtaking location is a popular tourist destination. It is a well-liked location for overnight camping or family picnics. It is a great camp experience out beneath a sky that is clear and blue and watching the stars.</p><ul><li><u>Discovering <strong>North Bengal&#8217;s Jewels</strong>:</u></li></ul><p>For tourists traveling from Kolkata and other locations to the state&#8217;s northern regions, Siliguri serves as a base and a layover. It is worthwhile to explore and take in <strong>North Bengal&#8217;s</strong> incredible nature. All of these locations may be found close to Siliguri. To go to these locations and roll in the lap of nature, all it takes is a short bus or car ride, or even a quick train ride. Siliguri serves as the entry point to some of West Bengal&#8217;s top tourist sites, including Darjeeling, the Dooars, Kalimpong, and Mirik.</p><ol start="3"><li><u>Eating in Siliguri</u></li></ol><ul><li>Siliguri experiences quite a mix of cultures which is manifested in their cuisine. Tourists get treated to the <strong>delicious Bengali cuisine with flavourful vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and mouthwatering Chinese and Tibetan food</strong> as well. Siliguri has a sizeable Tibetan population which accounts for the amazing tulpas and momos that you will find here. For sweets lovers, numerous <strong>Bengali sweet shops</strong> are selling amazing sweets. When in Siliguri there is no dearth of good food.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li><u>Shopping in Siliguri:</u></li></ol><ul><li>Because of the well-known <strong>Hong Kong Market</strong>, Siliguri is a shoppers&#8217; paradise. An ancient market in Hakim Para that sells a wide variety of imported goods may be found here. International brands can be bought for incredibly low prices when buying clothing and electronics. To their heart&#8217;s content, people come here to shop. Particularly affordable are electronic products. If you&#8217;ve had a long day of shopping, treat yourself to some <strong>delicious Bengali and Chinese food</strong> at the nearby <strong>Haveli Restaurant</strong>.</li></ul>						</div>

							<p>Sikkim is known to be one of the most well-known tourist destinations of India, and is one of the most beautiful destinations to visit in this world. Sikkim highlights the tourisms spot for all types of age groups, starting from Narula Pass to Kanchenjangha Falls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can visit Nathula Pass in Sikkim which highlights the India-China border and our well-respected Indian Army campsites along with a beautiful lake. If you visit Nathula Pass on a sunny day in winter within November to February, you will be blessed with the mesmerising views of the icy mountains and the reflections of the mountains on the lake will truly be a treat to your eyes and heart.</p>
<p>You can also visit Gurudongmar Lake which offers the same as Nathula Pass in a larger scale and also has an adjacent tourist destination, Cholamu Lake within 10Kms.</p>
<p>You can also visit Yumthang Valley with your friends and family. The bike rides here are a must if you decide to visit here. The contrast between the icy mountains and the green large hills and the zig-zag roads will make you young once again. The cloudy hills and the breeze that runs down your body when you ride a bike through the long roads of Yumthang valley makes you want to stay here a little bit more.</p>
<p>Little bit of break from the mountains? Sure.</p>
<p>You can now visit MG Marg. Here you can visit more than 144 restaurants and order your favourite food or even go shopping for you and your loved ones. MG Marg is also well known to have long walks with an umbrella down the road due to the spontaneously changing weather here, so you’ll also have the chance to see snowfalls during the winter season.</p>
<p>You can visit the endless spots like Gangtok, Lachung, Pelling, Namchi and so on.</p>						</div>

							<p>What comes in your mind when you think of a place where you can see and feel heaven? Well, whatever comes in your mind if it’s not Ladakh then you are missing out on great deal of enjoyment and lively experiences. When one think of visiting Ladakh, he should be preoccupied with certain information that our company is providing you.</p><p>Firstly, if you want to experience heavenly feeling, then no other place other than Ladakh could make you feel so. Ladakh is mostly journeyed by people on bike and by bike means bullet. The enriching and lovely experience you get if you travel Ladakh by bike is simply unparallel. Another great thing about visiting Ladakh is if you decide to visiting Ladakh then you can miss Leh, because often you might have heard Leh Ladakh together.</p><p>Next what you can see in Ladakh is India’s last outpost, Turtuk. It is known especially for apricots and all other varieties of fruits. Also, if you have heard of Siachen Glaciers, then turtuk is one of the gateways of it. If ever you have dreamt of floating through the clouds, then I guess Ladakh is one such place which can turn your dream into reality. So, if you are fascinated about visiting Ladakh, there here is how you can reach Ladakh from any corner of the earth. You can be rest assured that Leh Ladakh trip would be the best trip of your entire life.</p><p>So, to reach here one can come to Delhi first and then you can either rent bike or you can reach Ladakh with your private vehicle. The approx. distance from Delhi to Ladakh is 12003 km. You can either take Manali route or Srinagar route. The best experience would be by bike route. You will be experiencing the zig zag routes, the terrain, curvy roads, the terrain and many passes. The famous Khardung La pass comes along the way. Also, the Ladakh tourism offers many scenic beauty and scenarios for your eyes to rest upon.
